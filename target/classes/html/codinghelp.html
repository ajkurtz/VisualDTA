    <h1>VisualDTA Coding Help</h1>
    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2>File format</h2>
    <p>The file uploaded to the tool needs to be a TAB-delimited text file. The easiest way to create the file is to
        download the Excel template, add the coding, and save the file (Save As...) as TAB-delimited.</p>
    <p>The first row of the file must contain the column names so the system knows what information is in what column.
        Each row below the title row will be a data row and each column must have a value. Enter a &quot;NA&quot;
        (without the quotes) if no data is available for that column.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h2>File Columns</h2>
    <p>The file has four required columns (&quot;Proposition&quot;, &quot;Reponds To&quot;, &quot;Relation Type&quot;,
        and &quot;Distance&quot;) and three optional columns (&quot;Speaker&quot;, &quot;Dotted Line&quot;, and &quot;Description&quot;).
        Those seven columns will be recognized by the system and they are treated in special ways. See the descriptions
        below.</p>
    <p>Additional columns may be added to code additional attributes, such as Gender, Role, etc. Any columns that are
        not recognized as one of the known seven options ( &quot;Proposition&quot;, &quot;Reponds To&quot;, &quot;Relation
        Type&quot;, &quot;Distance&quot;, &quot;Speaker&quot;, &quot;Dotted Line&quot;, and &quot;Description&quot;)
        will be treated as attributes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Proposition</h3>
    <p>This is the unique identifier for the proposition. The identifier may contain numbers or text. This is required
        and must not be a &quot;NA&quot;.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Speaker</h3>
    <p>This is an identifier for the speaker. It may be any text or &quot;NA&quot;. This column is optional.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Responds To</h3>
    <p>This is the proposition identifier that this proposition is in reply to. It may be a valid proposition identifier
        or &quot;NA&quot; if this proposition is not in reply to another proposition.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Relation Type</h3>
    <p>This is the relation type of the proposition. It may be &quot;NA&quot; for the first proposition or one of the
        following:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <th align="right">Type</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="right">
                <div align="center">
                    T
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>On Topic</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="right">
                <div align="center">
                    P
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>Parallel Shift</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="right">
                <div align="center">
                    B
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>Break</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="right">
                <div align="center">
                    M
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>Meta Talk</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="right">
                <div align="center">
                    E
                </div>
            </td>
            <td>Explanation</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Distance</h3>
    <p>The distance is the semantic distance from the message replied to. On topic propositions are a distance of 0.
        Breaks are distance 4, and shifts are 1, 2, or 3. This is required to be a 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Dotted line</h3>
    <p>This indicates whether or not the reply to line is drawn as a dotted line or a solid line. A dotted line would be
        used to indicate a tenuous relationship. A 1 indicates that the line back to the proposition replied to is
        dotted. A 0 indicates that the line should be solid. This is required to be a 1 or 0. If this column is not
        included then all lines will be solid.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A text description used to reference back to the content of the proposition in the original message. May be a
        &quot;NA&quot;. This column is optional.</p>
    <p></p>
